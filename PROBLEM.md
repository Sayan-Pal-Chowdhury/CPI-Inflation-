# Reconstructed Problem Statement (based on provided solution & screenshots)

You are working with the National Statistical Office which releases CPI inflation numbers for India.
As an analyst, you are provided with monthly CPI indices (by category and sector) and asked to find insights.

Typical tasks:
1. Clean and preprocess the CPI dataset (handle missing values, normalize month names).
2. Compute year-on-year (Y-o-Y) percentage growth in the General index for Rural+Urban, and plot the trend.
   - Identify which year has the highest Y-o-Y inflation (average of months in that year).
3. For the 12 months ending May 2023 (i.e., Jun 2022 - May 2023):
   - Investigate trends in the broader food bucket (Food and beverages) and evaluate month-on-month changes.
   - Highlight the month with highest and lowest month-on-month food inflation.
   - Identify absolute changes in inflation over the same 12 months and the biggest individual category contributor (within food subcategories).
4. Explain methods used for handling missing values (imputation/moving averages) and limitations of CPI as an index.
5. Optional: Build charts and a short write-up summarizing reasons for any spikes (e.g., food price shocks), supported by external research (cite sources).
